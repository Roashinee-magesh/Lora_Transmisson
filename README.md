Overview

This project presents a 3-DOF robotic arm controlled using an ESP32 and PCA9685 servo driver. The system features an adaptive gripper that uses force feedback from FSR sensors to securely grasp objects without causing damage. The gripping action automatically stops when sufficient force is detected.

Features

2 × Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR)
1 kΩ Resistors (used in voltage divider with FSR)
External 5V Power Supply
Circuit Description
ESP32 to PCA9685 (I2C Communication)
SDA → GPIO 21
SCL → GPIO 22
VCC → 3.3V
GND → GND
Servos (Connected via PCA9685)
Channel 0 → Base Servo
Channel 1 → Arm Servo
Channel 2 → Gripper Servo
FSR Sensors (Voltage Divider Configuration)

Each FSR is connected as follows:

One terminal → 3.3V
Other terminal → Analog pin and 1 kΩ resistor to GND
Pins Used:
FSR1 → GPIO 34
FSR2 → GPIO 35
Control Commands
Key	Function
a	Base rotate left
d	Base rotate right
w	Arm move up
s	Arm move down
g	Close gripper (stops on force detection)
o	Open gripper
Working Principle

The gripper begins closing when the 'g' command is received. The FSR sensors continuously measure the applied force. When either FSR value crosses a predefined threshold, the gripping motion stops. This ensures safe and adaptive object handling.

Notes
FSR readings depend on resistor value (1 kΩ used in this project).
Threshold values may require calibration based on object type.
External power supply is required for stable servo operation.
Common ground between ESP32 and PCA9685 is essential.
Future Work
IMU-based weight estimation using tap frequency analysis
Wireless control using Bluetooth or WiFi
Automated pick-and-place functionality
